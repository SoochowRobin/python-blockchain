The blockchain is a list of blocks where each block represents a unit of storage for data. The list is called a chain because each block references the block before it, creating (chain) links between blocks.

Some basic python concepts:
A python module is a file that contains various Python definitions and statements. 

Mininig blocks refers to the process of running a computationally expensive algorithm in order to create new blocks for the blockchain. 
The <b>genesis block</b> is the first block in the blockchain. Since all blocks must reference the block that came before it, the genesis block serves as a hardcoded starter block for the chain. 

Encoding is the process of converting data into a particular format (such as the utf-8 format). For example, encoding a string in utf-8, would produce the equivalent byte string in utf-8 characters. Decoding converts the encoded data back into its original form.
